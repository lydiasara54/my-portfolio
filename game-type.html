            <strong>Rugby Union:</strong> The most popular form of rugby, played with 15 players on each team. Matches are 80 minutes long and include set pieces like scrums and line-outs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rugby League:</strong> Played with 13 players on each team. This version features a different scoring system and fewer stoppages, making for a faster-paced game.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rugby Sevens:</strong> A variation of rugby union with 7 players per team and shorter matches, typically 7 minutes per half. It's known for its speed and wide-open style of play.

        <li>
            <strong>Rugby Tens:</strong> Also known as "Ten-a-side rugby," it features 10 players on each team. It combines elements of both sevens and fifteen-a-side rugby.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Touch Rugby:</strong> A minimal-contact version of rugby where players "touch" their opponents instead of tackling. Itâ€™s popular for casual and mixed-gender games.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Tag Rugby:</strong> Similar to touch rugby but players wear tags that must be removed to indicate a tackle. It's often played by children and in training sessions.

            <strong>Wheelchair Rugby:</strong> A version of rugby for athletes with disabilities, played on a hard court. It combines elements of rugby, basketball, and handball.
